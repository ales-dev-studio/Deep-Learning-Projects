# üß† MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognizer

## üìã Project Overview

The **MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognizer** project demonstrates how to build and train a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network to classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) using the classic **MNIST dataset**.
This notebook provides a complete walkthrough ‚Äî from data loading and visualization to model training, performance evaluation, and interpretation of results.

The goal is to recognize images of handwritten digits by automatically learning their features from pixel data, showcasing how neural networks can solve pattern recognition problems.

## üìà Results Summary

| Metric                | Training                                             | Testing |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Accuracy**          | ~99%                                                 | ~97‚Äì98% |
| **Best Performance**  | On digits with clear shape (e.g., 0, 1, 7)           |         |
| **Common Confusions** | Between visually similar digits (e.g., 3 & 5, 4 & 9) |         |

The MLPClassifier achieves high accuracy without deep learning frameworks, demonstrating that even a simple feedforward neural network can perform well on structured datasets like MNIST.
